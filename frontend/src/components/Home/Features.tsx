              Immutability means something that canâ€™t be changed or altered.
              This is one of the top blockchain features that help to ensure
              that the technology will remain as it is, a permanent, unalterable
              network.

            <p>
            All the records in the blockchain are individually encrypted. Using encryption 
            adds another layer of security to the entire process on the blockchain network. 
            Since there is no central authority, it does not mean that one can simply add, 
            update or delete data on the network.Every information on the blockchain is hashed 
            cryptographically which means that every piece of data has a unique identity on 
            the network

            <p>
            The blockchain network is decentralized which means that there is no central 
            governing authority that will responsible for all the decisions. Rather a group of
            nodes makes and maintain the network. Each and every node in the blockchain network
            has the same copy of the ledger.

             All network participants have a copy of the ledger for complete transparency.
             A public ledger will provide complete information about all the participants on 
             the network and transactions. The distributed computational power across the 
             computers ensures a better outcome.
